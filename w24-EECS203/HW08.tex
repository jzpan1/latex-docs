\subsection*{\probnum Easy Peasy Degree-sy Squeezy [8 points]}
Let $G$ be a graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges. Let $M$ be the maximum degree of the vertices of $G$, and let $m$ be the minimum degree of the vertices of $G$. Show that
\begin{qparts}
    \item $\dfrac{2e}{v} \geq m$
    \item $\dfrac{2e}{v} \leq M$
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item The total degree of the vertices is $2e$, since each edge is counted twice by its two vertices. 
        \par Let every vertex have $2e$ "vacancies," that is, spots for edges to fill. (Essentially, for each vertex, this "vacancy" number is just the difference between $2e$ and the degree of that vertex.) Then there will be $2ev$ "vacancies" total among the vertices, before edges fill them. After subtracting the edges, there will be $2ev - 2e$ total "vacancies" left among the edges. Let the pigeons be the "vacancies" and the vertices be the holes. Then by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one vertex with at least $\frac{2ev - 2e}{v} = 2e - \frac{2e}{v}$ ``vacancies.'' This translates to a degree of $2e - \left(2e - \frac{2e}{v}\right) = \frac{2e}{v}$. So there is at least one vertex with degree at most $\frac{2e}{v}$. Since the minimum degree must be less than or equal to this, $\dfrac{2e}{v} \geq m$.
        \item The total degree of the vertices is $2e$, since each edge is counted twice by its two vertices. There are $v$ vertices (holes) and $2e$ total degree (pigeons). So by the pigeonhole principle, there is one vertex with degree at least $\dfrac{2e}{v}$. Since the maximum degree must be greater than or equal to this degree, $\dfrac{2e}{v} \leq M$.

\subsection*{\probnum The Forest Beyond the Trees [15 points]}

\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item This is not a tree since it contains a cycle subgraph. However, it is bipartite since it doesn't have a odd cycle.
        \item This is not a tree since it contains cycle subgraphs (e.g. the cycle of nodes 1-2-4). Additionally, it is not bipartite since it contains odd cycles. (e.g. the cycle of nodes 1-2-4).
        \item This is not a tree since it contains many cycle subgraphs. It is also not bipartite since it contains odd cycles. (Since it is complete, there is a cycle between any set of vertices, e.g. vertices 1, 2, 3)
        \item This is a tree because it contains no cycles. Additionally,

\subsection*{\probnum Ham and Cheese [15 points]}
A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that traverses through every vertex in a graph exactly once (starting and ending at the same vertex). How many Hamiltonian cycles are there in the complete graph $K_n$? Justify your answer.

\textbf{Note:} Two cycles are the same as long as the have the same vertices, and each vertex has the same left and right neighbors in the cycle. For instance the cycles $(a,b,c,a),$ $(b,c,a,b),$ and $(a,c,b,a)$ are all equivalent.

\section*{Grading of Groupwork \prevhwnum{}}
Using the solutions and Grading Guidelines, grade your Groupwork \prevhwnum{} Problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the table below to grade your past groupwork submission and calculate scores.
    \item While grading, mark up your past submission. Include this with the table when you submit your grading.
    \item Write whether your submission achieved each rubric item. If it didn't achieve one, say why not.
    \item For extra credit, write positive comment(s) about your work.
    \item You don't have to redo problems correctly, but it is recommended!
    \item See ``All About Groupwork" on Canvas for more detailed guidance, and what to do if you change groups.
