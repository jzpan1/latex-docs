\subsection*{\probnum Negation Transformation [12 points]}
Find the negation of each statement below. If your thought process involves intermediate steps, show them. If not, simply writing the negation is sufficient.

Your answer should not contain the original proposition. That is, you shouldn't negate it as ``It is not the case that ...'' or something similar.
\begin{qparts}
    \item Every student in this course is enrolled in exactly one Discussion section.
    \item There is a student in this class who is not on Gradescope or not on Piazza.
    \item For all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a+b > 0$, then $a-b < 0$.
    \item For every irrational number $x$, there is a rational number $y$ such that $x^y$ is rational.
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item There is at least 1 student in this course who is not enrolled in exactly 1 discussion section.
        \item Every student in this class is on both Gradescope and Piazza.
        \item There exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a+b > 0$ and $a-b \geq 0$.
        \item There is an irrational number $x$ for which there does not exist a rational number $y$ such that $x^y$ is rational.
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}

\subsection*{\probnum Not It [12 points]}
Negate the following statements so that all negation symbols immediately precede predicates. Make sure to show all intermediate steps.

\textbf{Note:} $\lnot (P(x)\vee Q(x))$ would not be considered fully simplified since the negation ($\lnot$) does not immediately come before $P(x)$ or $Q(x).$ However, $\lnot P(x) \vee \lnot Q(x)$ is fully simplified, for example.

\begin{qparts}
    \item $\forall y [ \exists x P(x,y) \vee \forall x Q(x, y) ]$
    \item $\exists x \forall y [ R(x,y) \rightarrow R(y, x) ]$
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item $\exists y [ \forall x \neg P(x,y) \wedge \exists x \neg Q(x, y) ]$
        \item $\forall x \exists y [ R(x,y) \wedge \neg R(y, x) ]$
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}

\subsection*{\probnum Order's Up! [12 points]}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the statement ``customer $x$ has ordered dish $y$," where the domain for $x$ consists of all customers and for $y$ consists of all dishes at a restaurant.  Express each of these propositions in logic.
\begin{qparts}
    \item Some customer has ordered some dish at this restaurant.
    \item Some customer has ordered all of the dishes at this restaurant.
    \item Each customer has ordered at least one dish at this restaurant.
    \item Some dish at this restaurant has been ordered by all customers.
    \item Each dish at this restaurant has been ordered by at least one customer.
    \item All customers have ordered every dish at this restaurant.
    \item Some dish at this restaurant has been ordered by a customer.
    \item Every dish at this restaurant has been ordered by every customer.
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item $\exists x \exists y [P(x, y)]$
        \item $\exists x \forall y [P(x, y)]$
        \item $\forall x \exists y [P(x, y)]$
        \item $\exists y \forall x [P(x, y)]$
        \item $\forall y \exists x [P(x, y)]$
        \item $\forall x \forall y [P(x, y)]$
        \item $\exists y \exists x [P(x, y)]$
        \item $\forall y \forall x [P(x, y)]$
    \end{qparts}    
\end{solution}

\subsection*{\probnum Sports Statements  [12 points]}
Let $I(x)$ be the statement ``$x$ has a favorite sport" and $C(x,y)$ be the statement ``$x$ and $y$ have the same favorite sport," where the domain for the variables $x$ and $y$ consists of all students in your class. Use quantifiers and the logical connectives you learned in lecture to express each of the statements below.

\textbf{Hint:} You can use an $=$ sign to compare people.
\begin{qparts}
    \item Someone in your class does not have a favorite sport.
    \item No one in the class has the same favorite sport as Chloe.
    \item Everyone except one student in your class has a favorite sport.
\end{qparts}


\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item $\exists x [\neg I(x)]$
        \item $\forall x [\neg C(x, \text{Chloe})]$
        \item $\exists x \forall y [\neg I(x) \wedge (x=y \vee I(y))]$
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}

\subsection*{\probnum Quantifier Quandary [12 points]}
For each of the propositions below, write the negation, and determine whether the original proposition is true or if its negation is true. Your negation cannot contain the logical ``not" symbol ($\lnot$), but you may use the not-equals sign ($\ne$). The domain of discourse is all real numbers. \textbf{Briefly justify your answers.}
\begin{qparts}
    \item $\exists x (x^3 = -1)$
    \item $\forall x (2x > x)$
    \item $\exists x \forall y (x+y = 0)$
    \item $\forall x \exists y (x+y = 0)$
\end{qparts}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item $\forall x (x^3 \neq -1)$. The original is true: $x=-1$ satisfies the original.
        \item $\exists x (2x \leq x)$. The negation is true: $x=-1$ satisfies the negation.
        \item $\forall x \exists y (x+y \neq 0)$. The negation is true: when $x$ is nonzero, $x+x =2x \neq 0$. When $x = 0$, $x + 1 = 1 \neq 0$.
        \item $\exists x \forall y (x+y \neq 0)$. The original is true: $x + (-x) = 0$ for any $x$.
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}

\subsection*{\probnum Even Stevens [8 points]}

Prove that if $n$ is an even integer, then $\frac{n^2}{2}$ is also an even integer.

\begin{solution}
    By definition, $n = 2m$ for some $m \in \ints$. Then \[\frac{n^2}{2} = \frac{(2m)^2}{2} = \frac{4m^2}{2} = 2m^2.\] We know $m$ is an integer, so $m^2$ is an integer. Thus $2m^2 = \frac{n^2}{2}$ is even.
\end{solution}

\subsection*{\probnum To Prove or Not To Prove [16 points]}

\textbf{Prove or disprove} each of the following statements where the domain of discourse is all real numbers.
\begin{qparts}
    \item For all $x,$ $x^2>0.$
    \item There exists $x$ such that $x\le 0$ and $2x > x.$
    \item There exists $x$ such that for all $y,$ $x^2+y^2>203.$
    \item There exists $x$ such that for all $y,$ $(x+y)^2>203.$
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item False. The value $x = 0$ is a counterexample: $x^2 = 0 \ngtr 0$.
        \item False. Subtracting $x$ on both sides from the inequality, it becomes $x > 0$. However, this is a contradiction with the other inequality $x \leq 0$. Thus both $x\le 0$ and $2x > x$ cannot be true.
        \item True. The value $x=15$ satisfies this: the least value $y^2$ can take is 0. When $y^2 = 0$, $x^2 + y^2 = 225 > 203.$
        \item False. For any $x$, choose $y = -x$. Then $(x+y)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \nless 203.$
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Mixed Quantifiers Proof [16 points]}

For this problem, let the domain of discourse be positive integers.
\begin{qparts}
    \item Consider the following predicate:
    $$ P(x, z) := (z > x) \land (x \,|\, z) \land (4 \nmid z) $$
    Let $x = 10$. Find the three smallest values of $z$ which satisfy $P(10, z).$

    \item Now prove the following proposition:
    $$ \forall x [ 4 \nmid x \to \exists z\, P(x, z) ]$$
\end{qparts}

\textbf{Note:} The statement $a\,|\, b$ means ``$a$ divides $b$," i.e. there exists some integer $q$ such that $b=aq.$ Similarly, $a\nmid b$ means ``$a$ does not divide $b.$"

\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item In English, the predicate means that $z$ is greater than $x$ and divisible by $x$ and not divisible by 4. When $x = 10$, the solutions $z=30, 50, 70$ fulfill these requirements. These are the smallest values since $z$ must be greater than 10.
    
        \item Assuming that $4 \nmid x$, we construct a $z$ which fulfills the requirements. Let $z = 5x$. Since $x$ is positive, $z = 5x > x$. We also know $x | z$ since $z = 5x$. Additionally, since $5x = 4x + x$, $z$ is not divisible by 4 because $4 | 4x$ and $4 \nmid x$. Thus $z$ fulfills predicate $P(x, z)$. 
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}

\section*{Groupwork \hwnum{} Problems}

\subsection*{\probnum Bézout's Identity [20 points]}

In number theory, there's a simple yet powerful theorem called Bézout's identity, which states that for any two integers $a$ and $b$ (with $a$ and $b$ not both zero) there exist two integers $r$ and $s$ such that $ar+bs=\gcd(a,b).$ Use Bézout's identity to prove the following statements (you may assume all variables are integers):

\begin{qparts}
    \item If $d\divides a$ and $d\divides b,$ then $d\divides \gcd(a,b).$
    \item If $a\divides bc$ and $\gcd(a,b)=1,$ then $a\divides c.$
\end{qparts}

\noindent
\textbf{Note:} $\gcd$ is short for ``greatest common divisor," so the value of $\gcd(a,b)$ is the largest integer that evenly divides $a$ and $b.$ You won't need to apply this definition, just know that $\gcd(a,b)$ is an integer.


\begin{solution} 

\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Proposition Michigan [20 points]}
Translate each of the following English statements into logic. You may define predicates as necessary.

\textbf{Note:} Your predicates should not trivialize the problem.

\begin{qparts}
    \item Each pair of students at UMich has at least two mutual friends at UMich. The domain of discourse is all students at UMich.

    \item Nobody knows everyone's Wolverine Access password except the Wolverine Access administrators, who know all passwords. The domain of discourse is all people who have a Wolverine Access account (the administrators have Wolverine Access accounts).
