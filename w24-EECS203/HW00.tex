Like all future homeworks, this assignment should be submitted as a PDF through
Gradescope (see instructions on course site for more details). We strongly prefer
students to compose homework solutions using a word processor (Google Docs or MS
Word), or ideally using \LaTeX, but we will accept handwritten homework submissions
scanned/photographed and converted to PDF. Note that submitted files must be less
than 50 mb in size, but they really should be much smaller than this. No email or
Piazza regrade requests will be accepted. For more detail on regrade requests,
please refer to course policies.
\begin{itemize}
\item We will not grade homework problems that were not properly matched on
Gradescope. Please submit early and often and double-check that you matched each
question to the page(s) where your solution appears.
\item Explanation or justification for yes/no, true/false, multiple choice
questions, and the like: You must provide some sort of explanation or justification
for these types of questions (so we know you didn’t just guess), unless explicitly
specified in the problem statement. For example, simply answering “true” for a T/F
question without providing an explanation will receive little or no credit.
\item All problems require work to be shown. Questions that require a numerical
answer will not be given credit if no work/explanation is shown.
\item Honor Code: By submitting this homework, you agree that you are in
compliance with the Engineering Honor Code and the Course Policies for 203, and
that you are submitting your own work.
\item Hyperlinks on Submitting Homework to Gradescope:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TITLE PAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\probnum Did You Read The First Page? [6 points]}
Did you read the first page? We get it, it's a lot of words. Please give it a read!
It's important information that you'll want to know as you complete homework
assignments throughout the semester to \textbf{avoid losing points from logistical
mistakes} \smiley{}. After you've given the first page a careful read over, write
what you're most excited about in 2024 as your ``answer" to this question.
\begin{solution}
    In 2024 I'm most excited to meet new people and learn new things!
\end{solution}
\newpage
\subsection*{\probnum A Thing About Page Matching [6 points]}
You must match your pages to the problems on Gradescope in order to receive credit.
Please note as soon as you press submit, you’ve successfully submitted by the
deadline. You can still match the pages with no rush, that doesn’t add to your
submission time. Write down your favorite class so far to affirm you've read and
understand this.
\begin{solution}
    My favorite class so far is Japanese. It's a fun break from all the STEMmy engineering classes I'm taking this semester.
\end{solution}
\newpage
\subsection*{\probnum Resource Location [12 points]}
Where can you find each of the following resources? No justification necessary.
\begin{qparts}
\item Lecture slides, lecture recordings, course announcements
\item Scheduled office hours
\item Questions and answers about course content and logistics (online forum)
\end{qparts}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}

\newpage
\subsection*{\probnum Exam dates [12 points]}
What are the dates and times of the three course exams? No justification necessary.
\begin{solution}
    Exam 1: Monday, February 19, 7:00 - 9:00 pm \\
    Exam 2: Wednesday, March 27, 7:00 - 9:00 pm \\
    Exam 3: Tuesday, April 30, 7:00 - 9:00 pm
\end{solution}
\newpage
\subsection*{\probnum Regrade Requests [16 points]}
\begin{qparts}
\item Where do you submit a regrade request?
\item What is the deadline for submitting regrade requests? Select \textbf{one}
of the following:
\begin{qsubparts}
\item by the last day of classes
\item by the next exam
\item 24 hours after the assignment's grades have been released
\item 1 week after the assignment's grades have been released
\end{qsubparts}
\item When should you submit a regrade request? Select \textbf{any number} of
the following:
\begin{qsubparts}
\item I feel like I deserve more points
\item My solution was incorrectly graded according to the posted rubric
\item I have an alternate solution I think is right
\item I have an alternate solution I think is right, and I checked it with
an instructor in office hours or on Piazza
\end{qsubparts}
\item What 3 things should you make sure to (re)read before submitting a
regrade request?
\end{qparts}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item Gradescope
        \item iv
        \item ii
        \item My submitted solution, the solution from the course, and the rubric
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}
\newpage
\subsection*{\probnum Admin Form [8 points]}
What is the best way to contact course staff about individual administrative
concerns, and where can you find the link?
\begin{solution}
    The \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe09tKn61q6FYKTXadv9gUQC6LmWSr2rdrNWG6tee-fzVm0SA/viewform}{admin form}, found on the front page of the course Canvas page. 
\end{solution}
\newpage
\subsection*{\probnum Reflection [8 points]}
What strengths, strategies, and resources do you have to help you succeed in each
of following?
\begin{qparts}
\item Weekly assignments
\item Exams
\end{qparts}
\begin{solution}
    Resources: Piazza, ECoach, lecture/discussion recordings, problem roulette, office hours, peers, previous exams, etc.
    You should work together with classmates on weekly assignments to pool more knowledge. Do a lot of practice problems for exams, and make sure to attempt them all before looking at the solutions.
\end{solution}
\newpage
\subsection*{\probnum Exponents [16 points]}
Compute the value of each of the following. We encourage you to keep it in
exponential form as long as you can, for practice. \textbf{Remember to show your
work.}
\begin{qparts}
\item $5^3$
\item $2^3\cdot 2^2$
\item $\frac{3^6}{3^3}$
\item $5^0$

\item $16^{-2}$
\end{qparts}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item $5^2 \cdot 5 = 25 \cdot 5 = 125$
        \item $2^3 \cdot 2^2 = 2^5 = 32$
        \item $\frac{3^6}{3^3} = 3^{6-3} = 3^3 = 27$
        \item $5^0 = 5^1 / 5^1 = 1$
        \item $(2^4)^2 = 2^{4*2} = 2^8 = 256$
        \item $2^{(4^2)} = 2^{16} = 65536$
        \item $16^{\frac{1}{2}} = (4^2)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 4$
        \item $16^{-2} = \frac{1}{16^2} = \frac{1}{256}$
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}
\newpage
\subsection*{\probnum Logarithms [16 points]}
Compute the value of each of the following. If the answer does not come out
cleanly and results in an infinite decimal expansion, write ``\textit{too hard to
compute}." If the result is not defined, write ``\textit{undefined}." For any
question referencing $x$ or $y,$ let $\log_5(x)=2.6$ and $\log_5(y)=5.2.$ \textbf{Remember to show your work.}

        \item $\log_7{0} = \text{undefined}$
        \item $\log_5(x+y) = \log_5(5^{2.6} + 5^{5.2}) = too\ hard\ to\ compute$
        \item $\log_5(xy) = \log_5(5^{2.6} \cdot 5^{5.2}) = \log_5(5^{2.6 + 5.2}) = 2.6 + 5.2 = 7.8$
        \item $\log_2(x) = \log_5(x)/\log_5(2) = too\ hard\ to\ compute$
        \item $\log_5(x^{25}) = 25\log_5(x) = 25 \cdot 2.6 = 65$
