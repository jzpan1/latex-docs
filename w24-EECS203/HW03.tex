\subsection*{\probnum On the Contrary [12 points]}
Let $n$ be an integer. Prove that if $4\,|\,(n^2-1),$ then $n$ is odd using
\begin{qparts}
    \item a proof by contraposition, and
    \item a proof by contradiction.
\end{qparts}
Then,
\begin{qparts}[resume]
    \item compare your answers to parts (a) and (b). What is different? What is the same?
\end{qparts}


\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item We will prove the contrapositive. Assume $n$ is even. Then $n$ can be expressed as $2m$, where $m$ is an integer. Then $n^2-1 = (2m)^2 - 1 = 4m^2 - 1$. $m^2$ is an integer, so $n^2-1$ is not divisible by 4. Thus the contrapositive is true, and the original statement is also true.
        \item Assume $4\,|\,(n^2-1)$ and $n$ is even. Then $n$ can be expressed as $2m$, where $m$ is an integer. Then $n^2-1 = (2m)^2 - 1 = 4m^2 - 1$. $m^2$ is an integer, so $n^2-1$ is not divisible by 4. This contradicts our original assumption, so the assumption is false.
        \item The assumption for contradiction contains one more clause. The contrapositive proof is to prove a truth, while the contradiction proves falsity. However, most of the steps taken to prove these two are the same, such as using $n = 2m$.
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum An Even-Numbered Question about Even Numbers [16 points]} 

\textbf{Prove or disprove} the following statements:

\begin{qparts}
    \item For all integers $x$, if $x$ is even, then $x^2$ is even.
    \item For all integers $x$, if $x^2$ is even, then $x$ is even.
    \item For all integers $x$, if $x$ is even, then $2x$ is even.
    \item For all integers $x$, if $2x$ is even, then $x$ is even.
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item Assume $x$ is even. Then $x$ can be expressed $2m$, where $m$ is an integer. Then $x^2 = (2m)^2 = 4m^2 = 2(2m^2)$. $2m^2$ is an integer since $m$ is an integer, so $x^2$ is even.  
        \item We will prove the contrapositive. Assume $x$ is odd. Then $x$ can be written $2k + 1$ where $k$ is an integer. Then $x^2$ can be expressed $(2k+1)^2 = 4k^2+ 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$. So $x^2$ is not even when $x$ is odd, and the given statement is true.
        \item $2x$ is always even by definition, so the implication is true.
        \item False. Consider $x=1$. $2x =2$ is even, but $x$ is odd.
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Even Stevens [16 points]}
\textbf{Prove or disprove} the following statement: ``There is a finite amount of even numbers."
\begin{solution}
    Assume the statement is true, and let $2n$ be the largest of these even numbers, where $n$ is an integer. Then $2n + 2 = 2(n+1)$ is even by definition, so $2n$ was not the largest even number and there is a contradiction. Thus the statement is false.
\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Pay it Forward (Or Don't, It's Up To You) [12 points]}
Consider a centipede game, where there are two players: Ka-chun and Zyaire. The game starts by Ka-chun's decision of take or wait.

\begin{itemize}
    \item If Ka-chun takes, Ka-chun earns \$1 while Zyaire earns nothing, and the game ends.
    \item If Ka-chun waits, then Zyaire can choose between take or wait. If Zyaire takes, Zyaire earns \$2 while Ka-chun earns nothing and the game ends. If Zyaire waits it becomes Ka-chun's turn to choose again.
    \item If they keep waiting the reward grows by \$1 each round, until Zyaire's choice of taking \$20 or waiting, when the game will end no matter what.
\end{itemize} Both of Ka-chun and Zyaire want to maximize their rewards, and behave as perfect logicians.

\begin{qparts}
    \item Suppose Ka-chun and Zyaire made it to round 20. What happens in round 20? 
    \item Using your answer to (a), what would happen if they made it to round 19?
    \item Building off of parts (a) and (b), argue that Ka-chun should take \$1 in the very first round.
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{qparts}
        \item In round 20, Zyaire is required to take the \$20.
        \item In round 19, Ka-chun knows Zyaire will take the \$20 next round, so he will take \$19 in this round to maximize his reward, instead of getting nothing next round.
        \item In round 18, Zyaire will have the same reasoning as Ka-chun in round 19, so he would take the money in this round. Ka-chun, knowing this, would then take the money in round 17. This pattern extends similarly until the first round, where Ka-chun knows Zyaire will to take the money in the next round. So, Ka-chun should take the \$1 in the first round.
    \end{qparts}
\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Proofs to the Max [12 points]}

Prove that for all real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, if $\max\left \{a^2(b-c), -a\right \}$ is non-negative, then $a\leq 0$ or $b\geq c$.

\textbf{Note:} You can use the following facts in your proof:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $x$ and $y$ are positive, then $x\cdot y$ is positive.
    \item If $x$ is positive and $y$ is negative, then $x\cdot y$ is negative.
    \item If $x$ and $y$ are negative, then $x\cdot y$ is positive.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}
    Assume $\max\left \{a^2(b-c), -a\right \}$ is non-negative. We will use casework. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \par (Case 1) Assume $\max\left \{a^2(b-c), -a\right \} = a^2(b-c)$. Then $a^2(b-c)$ is nonnegative.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If $a^2(b-c) = 0$, one or both of the factors is 0 by the zero product property (0 can only be the product of 0 and some other number). If $a^2 = 0$, then $a = 0 \leq 0$ and the statement is true. If $b-c = 0$, then $b=c$ and the statement is true.
            \item If $a^2(b-c) = 0$, either both $x$ and $y$ are positive or negative by the given facts.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Let's All Be Rational [16 points]}

Show that these statements about a real number $x$ are equivalent to each other:
\begin{stmts}
    \item $x$ is rational
    \item $\frac{x}{2}$ is rational
    \item $3x-1$ is rational.
\end{stmts}

\textbf{Hint:} One way to prove statements (i), (ii) and (iii) are equivalent is by proving (i) $\rightarrow$ (ii), (ii) $\rightarrow$ (iii), and (iii) $\rightarrow$ (i).

Using the solutions and Grading Guidelines, grade your Groupwork 2 Problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the table below to grade your past groupwork submission and calculate scores.
    \item While grading, mark up your past submission. Include this with the table when you submit your grading.
