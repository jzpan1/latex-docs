\question Show that the space curve with parametric equation $\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle t^2 - 1, 6 + 3t - t^2, 4 - 6t\rangle$ lies in a plane, and find the equation of this plane. \textit{Hint}: If $r(t)$ lies in a plane, what must be true for $\mathbf{r'}(t)$?
	\begin{solution}
		We find the tangent vector to this curve, allowing us to search for possible normal vectors.
		\[ \mathbf{r'}(t) = \langle 2t, 3 - 2t, -6 \rangle\]
		We can see that the vector $\langle 2, 2, 1 \rangle$ will always be orthogonal with this curve, as dotting it with the tangent vector always grants 0. Thus, it lies in a plane with equation
		\[ \boxed{2(x + 1) + 2(y - 6) + (z - 4) = 0}. \tag*{\qed} \]

			A parallel orthogal unit vector to this plane is $\langle 0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \rangle$. Finding the cross product and normalizing, we get $\langle -\frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \rangle$ We can treat this as a basis for 2D coordinates on the given plane. Multiplying $2\sin(t)$ by the first and $2\cos(t)$ by the second respectively will give the parameterized terms. Then the total parametric equation of the circle is 
			\[ \boxed{\langle 1 - \frac{4}{\sqrt{6}}\cos(t), 2 + \sqrt{2}\sin(t) + \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\cos(t), 0 - \sqrt{2}\sin(t) + \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\cos(t) \rangle} \tag*{\qed} \]

\question The plane curve with parametrization $r(t) = \langle e^t \cos 2t, e^t \sin 2t\rangle, t \in \mathbb{R}$, is an example of a Bernoulli
spiral. Show that the angle $\varphi$ between the position vector $\mathbf{r}(t)$ and the tangent vector $\mathbf{r}'(t)$ is constant, and find the value of $\varphi$ in radians to two decimal places.
	\begin{solution}
		We find the dot product of the position and tangent vector:
		\begin{align*}
			\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r'} &= \langle e^t \cos 2t, e^t \sin 2t \rangle \cdot \langle e^t \cos 2t - 2e^t \sin 2t, e^t \sin 2t + 2e^t \cos 2t \rangle \\
			&= e^{2t} \cos^2 2t - e^{2t} \cos 2t \sin 2t + e^{2t} \sin^2 2t + e^{2t} \cos 2t \sin 2t \\
			& = e^{2t} \cos^2 2t + e^{2t} \sin^2 2t \\
			&= e^{2t}
		\end{align*}
		The norms of $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{r'}$ respectively are $e^t$ and $\sqrt{5}e^t$, so the cos of the angle is thus a constant $\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$. Then 
		\[ \arccos (\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}) = \boxed{\varphi = 1.107148718} \tag*{\qed} \]

					&= \int_{0}^{2\pi}R\sqrt{2 - 2\cos(t)}dt \\

\question An \textit{involute} is the curve traced out by the end of a taut string being unwound from a given curve, in the plane of the curve. Let's consider the circle involute that arises when we unwind string from a spool. In the figure below the unwound string is shown in purple, the angle between the green line segment and the purple line segment is $\frac{\pi}{2}$, and the spool, which has radius R, is shown in orange. The circle involute is shown in black, and we wish to parametrize the circle involute in terms of the angle $\theta$; that is, we want to find a vector valued function $\mathbf{r}(\theta)$ for $\theta \geq 0$ so that its associated space curve is the circle involute.\\
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics*[scale=0.3]{images/03-involute.png}
\end{center}
	\begin{parts} 
		\part What is the length of the unwound thread (that is, the purple line segment) as a function of $\theta$?
			\begin{solution}
				Since the thread is taut around the circumference of the circle, it the length unraveled is equal to the arclength which $\theta$ has already passed through. This is equal to $\boxed{R\theta }$.
			\end{solution}
		\part What is $\mathbf{r}(\theta)$? Hint: It may help to first find the vector that moves from the origin to the edge ofthe circle (the green line in the diagram) and then find the vector that moves from the edge of the circle to the involute (the purple line in the diagram).
			\begin{solution}
				The green vector can simply use the parametric equation of a circle with radius $R$:  $\langle R\cos(\theta), R\sin(\theta) \rangle$. \\
				The purple vector is a vector with direction perpendicular to the radius and a magnitude equal to the length of the string. The direction can be given by $\langle \sin(\theta), -\cos(\theta) \rangle$. Multiplying by the magnitude, we get $\langle R\theta\sin(\theta), -R\theta\cos(\theta) \rangle$. Adding the two together, we find $\boxed{\mathbf{r}(\theta) = \langle R\cos(\theta) + R\theta\sin (\theta), R\sin(\theta) - R\theta\cos(\theta) \rangle}$. \qed

\question 
	\begin{parts}
		\setcounter{partno}{2}
		\part What is the length of the curve from $\theta = 0$ to $\theta = b$?
			\begin{solution}
				Using the arclength formula:
				
				\begin{align*}
					\int_{0}^{b} \sqrt{(\frac{dx}{d\theta})^2+ (\frac{dx}{d\theta})^2} &= \int_{0}^{b} R\sqrt{(\theta \cos(\theta) + \sin(\theta) - \sin(\theta))^2 + (\theta \sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta) - \cos(\theta))^2} d\theta \\
					&= \int_{0}^{b} R\sqrt{(\theta \cos(\theta) )^2 + (\theta \sin(\theta))^2} d\theta \\
					&= \int_{0}^{b} R\sqrt{\theta^2} d\theta \\
					&= \int_{0}^{b} R\theta d\theta \\
					&= \boxed{\frac{Rb^2}{2}} \tag*{\qed}
				\end{align*}
			\end{solution}
		\part Parametrize the circle involute in terms of arc length.
			\begin{solution}
				We found the arclength $s=\frac{R\theta^2}{2}$. The parametrization in terms of $s$ is thus
				\[ \boxed{\mathbf{r}(s) = \langle R\cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{2s}{R}}\right) + R\sqrt{\frac{2s}{R}}\sin \left(\sqrt{\frac{2s}{R}}\right), R\sin\left(\sqrt{\frac{2s}{R}}\right) - R\sqrt{\frac{2s}{R}}\cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{2s}{R}}\right) \rangle} \]
			\end{solution}
		\part Compute the curvature of the circle involute. \textit{Hint:} The book contains several different ways to compute the curvature $\kappa$. Some may be easier than others. 
			\begin{solution}
				We can compute the curvature by calculating the magnitude of the derivative of the unit tangent vector $\bm{T'}(\theta)$ and dividing by the magnitude of the tangent vector $\mathbf{r'}(\theta)$. 
				The tangent vector is 
				\begin{align*}
					\mathbf{r'}(\theta) &= \langle -R\sin(\theta) + R\sin (\theta) + R\theta\cos(\theta), R\cos(\theta) - R\cos(\theta) + R\theta\sin(\theta)\rangle \\
					&= \langle R\theta\cos(\theta), R\theta\sin(\theta) \rangle
				\end{align*}
				Of course, the unit tangent vector is then just the parametric equation of a circle. The derivative of the unit tangent vector is still a parametric circle, so it has magnitude 1. The tangent vector has magnitude $R\theta$, so the curvature of the involute is \[\boxed{\frac{1}{R\theta}} \tag*{\qed}\]

\question A quarterback intends to throw a pass to score a touchdown. Suppose the quarterback is 20 yards from
	the endzone, and the receiver is standing $\ln (21 + \sqrt{440})$ yards to the left of the quarterback. (The
	receiver is very good at calculus, and so knows the correct position to stand at to make this work -- it is
	approximately 3.737 yards, or just over 11 feet.) The receiver will always run directly at the location of
	the ball (this is not the most efficient path to catching the ball, but it does allow for flexibility if plans
	change, i.e. a member of the opposing team intercepts the ball). Because the ball is moving, this means
	that the receiver will trace out a special curve called a catenary. For simplicity, suppose the receiver
	is placed at the origin, and the quarterback is at the point $(\ln (21 + \sqrt{440}) , 0, 0)$. To make the play
	as efficiently as possible, the quarterback wants the receiver to catch the ball as soon as they hit the
	end zone, i.e. at the point $(\ln (21 + \sqrt{440}) , 20, 0)$. In this coordinate system, the path of the receiver is given by
	\[ \mathbf{r}(x) = \langle x, \cosh(x) - 1, 0 \rangle \],
	where we recall the definitions of the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions as given by
	\[\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2} \text{ and } \cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}\]
	\begin{parts}
		\part If the quarterback can throw the ball with a speed of 50 feet per second, at what angle above the ground should the quarterback throw the ball? Remember that the motion of the football is in the $yz$-plane in this coordinate system, and the acceleration due to gravity is given by $\langle 0, 0, -g\rangle$, with
		$g = 32 $ ft/s$^2$.
		\part How fast does the receiver need to run in order to catch the ball?
