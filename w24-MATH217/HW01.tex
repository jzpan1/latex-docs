\begin{questions}

\question Decide whether the following statements are true or false. Brieﬂy justify your answers.
	\begin{parts}
		\part 2 is even or 3 is odd.
		\begin{solution}
			\boxed{\text{True,}} both P and Q are true, so the "or" statement is also true.
		\end{solution}
        \part If the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then 217 is not a prime number.
		\begin{solution}
			\boxed{\text{True,}} Q is true. "If" propositions can only be false when Q is false.
		\end{solution}
		\part $\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$ if and only if $tan(\pi/6) = \sqrt{3}$.
		\begin{solution}
			\boxed{\text{True,}} both P and Q are true, so $P \implies Q$ and $Q \implies P$ are true. 
		\end{solution}
		\part If the set of even prime numbers is infinite, then 10 is even and $10^10$ is odd.
		\begin{solution}
			\boxed{\text{True,}} P is false.
		\end{solution}
		\part If every right triangle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has two acute angles, then every real number has a positive cube root.
		\begin{solution}
			\boxed{\text{False,}} P is true but Q is false.
		\end{solution}
	\end{parts}

\question 
	\begin{parts}
		\part Let P (x) be a statement whose truth value depends on x. An example is a value of x that makes $P (x)$ true, and a counterexample is a value of x that makes P (x) false. Fill in the blank spaces with “is true”, “is false”, or “nothing” as appropriate:
		\begin{solution}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
					\hline
					& ``$\forall x, P(x)$'' & ``$\exists x \text{ s.t. } P(x)$'' \\ 
					\hline
					An example proves & nothing & is true \\ 
					\hline
					A counterexample proves & is false & nothing \\ 
					\hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{center}
		\end{solution}
		\part Every prime number is even or odd.
			\begin{solution}
				True, prime numbers are all integers, which are all either even or odd.
			\end{solution}
		\part Every prime number is even or every prime number is odd.
			\begin{solution}
				False, 3 and 2 are counterexamples respectively.
			\end{solution}
		\part There exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that for every $x \in \mathbb{R}, n < x.$
			\begin{solution}
				False, if you fix such a $n$, $n \nless n-1$ which is a contradiction.
			\end{solution}
		\part For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n<x$.
			\begin{solution}
				True, $n = \lfloor x \rfloor < x$ by definition.
			\end{solution}
		\part Some squares are rectangles.
			\begin{solution}
				True, all squares are rectangles, so some squares are also rectangles.
			\end{solution}
		\part For every nonnegative real number $a$, there exists a unique real number $x$ such that $x^2 = a$.
			\begin{solution}
				False, $4 = 2^2 = (-2)^2$.
			\end{solution}
	\end{parts}

%3
\question Formulate the negation of each of the statements below in a meaningful way (these statements have been recycled from Problems 1 and 2). Note: just writing “It is not the case that . . . ” before each statement will not receive credit, as that does not help the reader understand the meaning of the negation. (No justiﬁcation is needed – you may just write the negation).
	\begin{parts}
		\part 2 is even or 3 is odd.
			\begin{solution}
				2 is not even and 3 is not odd.
			\end{solution}
		\part If the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then 217 is not a prime number.
			\begin{solution}
				The Riemann Hypothesis is true and 217 is a prime number.
			\end{solution}
		\part $\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$ if and only if $tan(\pi/6) = \sqrt{3}$.
			\begin{solution}
				$\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$ if and only if $tan(\pi/6) \neq \sqrt{3}$.
			\end{solution}
		\part If the set of even prime numbers is infinite, then 10 is even and $10^10$ is odd.
			\begin{solution}
				The set of even prime numbers is infinite, and either 10 is not even or $10^10$ is not odd.
			\end{solution}
		\part If every right triangle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has two acute angles, then every real number has a positive cube root.
			\begin{solution}
				Every right triangle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has two acute angles, and every real number does not have a positive cube root.
			\end{solution}
		\part There exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that for every $x \in \mathbb{R}, n < x.$
			\begin{solution}
				For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, no $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ exists such that $n < x$.
			\end{solution}
		\part Some squares are rectangles.
			\begin{solution}
				All squares are not rectangles.
			\end{solution}

\question Write both the converse and the contrapositive of the following “if-then” statements.
	\begin{parts}
		\part If something can think, then it exists.
		\part If $p$ is an irrational number, then $p^2$ is an irrational number.
		\part If $n > 2$ is a natural number such that the Collatz sequence beginning with $n$ does not eventually reach 1, then $n^2 + 1$ is prime.
	\end{parts}
